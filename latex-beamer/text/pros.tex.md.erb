\begin{frame}[fragile]{Pros}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item We can have combo in git!
    \item We can use all the niceties of github (issues, actions, online code browser, reviews, ...)
    \item Automatic checks and CI for pull requests and commits
    \item All histories are preserved
    \item No redundant repos, i.e. no need to sort and migrate commits by hand, later
    \item Meta projects in svn still work
    \item As frustration-free as possible for the users
    \item People can still push to master or to trunk on the svn bridge; but we do encourage pull requests and code reviews; \small it has a nice feel to get code reviewed and approved
  \end{itemize}
