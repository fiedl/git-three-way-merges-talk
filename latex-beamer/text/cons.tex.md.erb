\begin{frame}[fragile]{Cons}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item This is no silent change, but every icecuber has to do something
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Get a github account
        \item Get access to the IceTrayCombo github repo
        \item Do a fresh checkout, or change the source url, or do a git clone
      \end{itemize}
    \item There is a time delay of possibly several seconds after pushing to master, after which a push can be rejected and reset.
    \item People that love the beauty of linear commit histories may be disappointed at first (but we can still provide a beautified `git log` command)
  \end{itemize}
