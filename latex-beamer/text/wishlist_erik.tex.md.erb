  \begin{itemize}
    \item Sandboxes: Use private github account; also svn sandboxes will not disappear.
    \item Also plan for analysis code and papers (slide 7)
    \item Suggests shadow projects to allow release-based imports into meta projects
      \begin{itemize}
        \item We can have svn meta projects without shadow projects using svn externals and github's svn bridge, or by using a manager like gitman
        \item See also: Discussion: Single combo repo vs. separate project repos
      \end{itemize}
    \item Svn is not going away
      \begin{itemize}
        \item We can keep our svn repo readonly
        \item Maybe we can use github's svn bridge
        \item But we should *not* allow a separate svn repo for write access to save us from the work of sorting and cross-syncing
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
