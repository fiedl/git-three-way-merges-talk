\begin{frame}[fragile]{Why?}
  Why is it useful to consider these things?

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Automatic \alert{conflict resolution} can \alert{save time}
    \item Possible to \alert{track} where things came from (implementation \alert{context})
    \item No downsides, except one needs to sometimes be extra careful when applying these tools.\\
      But: Can always try locally and push later because git can be used decentralized.
  \end{itemize}
