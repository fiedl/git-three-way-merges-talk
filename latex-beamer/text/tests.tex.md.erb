  Run a series of tests for individual steps of the concept:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item[\done] \href{https://github.com/fiedl/monopole-generator/issues/3}{Test merging a project into combo while preserving both histories}.
    \item[\done] \href{https://github.com/fiedl/icecube-git-migration/issues/2}{Use svn externals to get github combo code into svn meta projects}.
    \item[\done] \href{https://github.com/fiedl/icecube-git-migration/issues/2}{Use gitman to get projects into svn meta projects}.
    \item[\done] \href{https://github.com/fiedl/icecube-combo-install}{Use github actions to run build}
    \item[\done] \href{https://github.com/fiedl/monopole-generator-install}{Use github actions to run unit tests}
    \item[\inprogress] \href{https://github.com/fiedl/icecube-combo-install}{Test how to change the origin sources of local repos: `svn external`? `svn relocate`? `git clone`?}
    \item[\inprogress] Import pre-combo history while preserving the current combo git history

  After that, test the concept as a whole:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item[\tobedone] Create a private, but writable proof-of-concept copy of \href{https://github.com/IceCube-SPNO/IceTrayCombo}{IceTrayCombo} and usage and migration info in `README.md`
    \item[\tobedone] Test local migration of combo with a group of people
    \item[\tobedone] Test local migration of a meta project with a group of people
    \item[\tobedone] Test committing to combo with a group of people
    \item[\tobedone] Test updating a meta project with a group of people
  \end{itemize}
