    \begin{itemize}
      \item Want to go \textit{somewhere forward}
      \item Not everyone would support the same goals/choices\\
        or does care to use the same git features/tools.
      \item I've talked to Nathan and other people that I thought would prefer other choices than myself.
      \item[\follows] \alert{Compromise}

  \begin{onlyenv}<2>
    \begin{itemize}
      \item In principle, \alert{allow} much. Otherwise, there will be friction, and there will be forks with other settings.
        But give \alert{clear encouragements} in easy-to-digest guides.
        \begin{itemize}
          \item \alert{Allow} direct pushes to \alert{`main`}. But \alert{encourage pull-request} workflow \& provide good guides.
          \item \alert{Don't enforce} but \alert{encourage linear} histories. There are valid cases when using non-linear histories is useful. But guide users how to keep the \alert{changelog clean}.
          \item Also up to the maintainer or admin whether to \alert{squash/rebase/merge} a \alert{particular pull request}. There are valid cases for each.
            Inexperienced contributors may need more guidance here.
        \end{itemize}
      \item Accept that this model is \alert{not bullet-proof} for now and allow \alert{iterations} of this \alert{workflow} (Erik).
      \item Don't forget to prompt the \alert{commit id} rather than the svn revision in icetray.
      \item \alert{Never rewrite history} \scriptsize when people had the chance to base work on it.
    \end{itemize}
